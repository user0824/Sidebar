## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Interactive Visual Board

- **Drag-and-drop interface** for creating system architecture diagrams
- **30+ system components** including Web Servers, Databases, Load Balancers, Message Queues, CDNs, and more
- **Real-time connections** between components to visualize data flow and relationships
- **Categorized components** (Compute, Storage, Network, Messaging, Security) for easy organization

### 🤖 AI Interview Simulator

- **Realistic mock interviews** that follow industry standard system design interview patterns
- **Context aware questioning** based on the components and connections placed on the board
- **Progressive interview phases**: Requirements Clarification → High Level Design → Deep Dive → Scale & Reliability
- **Constructive feedback** and performance evaluation with actionable insights

### 💾 Robust Data Management

- **User authentication** and project management
- **Persistent storage** of board designs and chat history
- **Project sharing** capabilities for collaboration and review
- **Real-time synchronization** of board state with AI conversation context

### 🎯 Educational Focus

- **Structured interview flow** following best practices from top tier tech companies
- **Multiple difficulty levels** from new grad to senior engineer scenarios
- **Comprehensive component library** covering modern distributed systems patterns
- **Performance tracking** and improvement suggestions

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **React** with TypeScript for type safe component development
- **Interactive board** using modern drag-and-drop React Flow library
- **Real-time chat interface** with markdown support
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile usage

### Backend

- **Node.js** server with RESTful API design
- **PostgreSQL** database with optimized schema for scalability
- **UUID-based** primary keys for distributed system compatibility
- **JSONB storage** for flexible component properties

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core entities
Users → Projects → Components/Connections
     → Chat Sessions → Messages
     → Scratch Notes
```

### AI Integration

- **Contextual prompting** system that understands board state
- **Interview phase management** with appropriate questioning strategies
- **Performance evaluation** algorithms for constructive feedback

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Start Interview**: Choose from various system design problems (URL Shortener, Chat App, Video Streaming, etc.)
2. **Requirements Phase**: AI interviewer asks clarifying questions about scale, features, and constraints
3. **Design Phase**: Build your architecture by dragging components onto the visual board
4. **Deep Dive**: AI probes deeper into specific components and design decisions
5. **Scale Discussion**: Explore how your design handles growth and reliability challenges
6. **Feedback**: Receive detailed performance analysis and improvement suggestions

## 🏗️ Available System Components

**Compute**: Web Server, Microservice, API Gateway, Service Discovery, Circuit Breaker, Health Check

**Storage**: Database, Cache, Relational DB, Object Storage, In-Memory Cache, Data Warehouse

**Network**: Load Balancer, CDN, Reverse Proxy, DNS, Firewall

**Messaging**: Message Queue, Message Broker, Pub/Sub Event Bus, Stream Processing

**Security**: Authentication Service, Authorization, Rate Limiter, WAF, VPN

**Monitoring**: Monitoring, Logging, Metrics, Analytics, APM, Real-time Dashboard

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Software Engineers** preparing for system design interviews
- **Computer Science Students** learning distributed systems concepts
- **Engineering Teams** conducting internal training and knowledge sharing
- **Interview Coaches** looking for interactive teaching tools
